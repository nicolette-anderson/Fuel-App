# Fuel App
A simple application that takes a user's current city and destination city, calculates the mileage between them and tells you: 
1. If you'll make it to your destination before you run out of gas
2. How much the tank of gas will cost you in your destination and current cities

This is based on a hybrid mid-size sedan, since that is what the author drives. :)
